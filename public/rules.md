This Discord server will serve as the official replacement for traditional CS Open Lab in Phelps 3525 and 3526, at least until in-person instruction resumes. 

**All university policies and common sense rules still apply in this server**, in addition to the rules listed below. 

1. **Be kind to each other.**

    Please don’t say or do anything here that you wouldn’t feel comfortable doing or receiving in real life.

2. **Respect each others’ privacy.**

    Don’t unnecessarily ping or DM others in the server, and don’t share others’ personal information here. If you have a message or event that you would like to share with everyone, consider submitting an announcement for approval. 

3. **Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, explicit content, etc. is not tolerated.**

    Anyone found posting such remarks in this server, in DMs to other users from this server, or through their Discord username, status, or profile picture, will result in removal from the CS Open Lab server and possibly reported for academic misconduct. If you want to keep a clear distinction between your personal and school life, we recommend creating a separate Discord account for this server.

4. **Do not share answers to assignments or exams/quizzes on this server.**

    While we encourage you to post any questions you may have here and help others by discussing those questions, please do not share answers to assignments and exams, or large code snippets for programming assignments, until that item’s deadline (including late deadlines) has passed. If a member of your course staff sees this, you may be reported for academic misconduct.

5. **Do not discuss confidential information on this server, such as grades.**

    This server is not covered under FERPA guidelines, and such conversations should be made to the instructors and TAs using the official channels of communication for your class, such as email and Slack. 

6. **Please refrain from directly messaging the instructors using Discord unless given permission to do so.**

    If you need to speak with an instructor privately, please do so using the official channels of communication for your class, such as email, Slack, and Piazza. If absolutely necessary, please create a private channel within this server using the CS Open Lab Bot instead of using Discord’s native DMs.

7. **Keep the Discord organized.**

    Please keep discussions in their respective channels. Off-topic discussions are allowed, but if done in a public channel, please keep them in off-topic channels such as #cs-lounge.

8. **This server is not intended to replace official course websites / communication platforms (Piazza, Slack, Gauchospace, etc…)**

    Official course announcements regarding labs, assignments, exams, or other course materials will not be made on this server. ULAs may post reminders about upcoming due dates, but do not rely on this server to keep you up to date on your courses; please refer to your official course website / communication platform.
